allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash]

<objective>
Audit the project's CLAUDE.md for strategy compliance, interactively rewrite it section by section, and route operational rules to CARL or an artifact.

**When to use:** "audit claude md", "check my claude.md", "rewrite my claude.md", after major workspace changes.

Follow task: @{~/.qwen/commands/qwen-base/tasks/audit-claude-md.md}

Key gates (do NOT skip):
1. Load strategy + template BEFORE reading user's CLAUDE.md
2. Present full audit classification — wait for user approval
3. Detect CARL — wait for user decision on rule routing
4. Propose each section individually — wait for approval per section
5. Write to CLAUDE.base.md (never overwrite CLAUDE.md)
</process>

- [ ] CARL detection completed, rule routing decided
- [ ] Each section approved individually
- [ ] Final CLAUDE.base.md under 100 lines
- [ ] Original CLAUDE.md untouched
